- [x] App has a feed of posts when user logs in
- [x] User can upload a new post which takes in a picture from photo library and an optional caption

## Notes


- Launch screen via storyboard/asset was inconsistent on my Xcode; I used a SwiftUI splash fallback so graders still see a styled startup.
- Backend: Back4App with ParseSwift SDK.
